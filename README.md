Project Idea:

Student Mental Health Support Website

On the home page, there were suggestions for dealing with stress, anxiety, handling depression, and struggling with addiction. We provide key features and links to external websites. There is also a therapist AI to answer your questions.

If you prefer to meet in person, you could use our scheduler to pick a date and time convenient for your visit. You can choose either a counselor or therapist based on your preference.
