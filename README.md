2024 Crimson Code Hackathon Team Project
Team Members: Chance Bradford, Wenjie Wang, Yuuki Matsunari 

### Project Idea: Student Mental Health Support Website

On the home page, there were suggestions for dealing with stress, anxiety, handling depression, and struggling with addiction. We provide key features and links to external websites. There is also a therapist AI to answer your questions.

If you prefer to meet a therapist or counseler in person, We offer a scheduling page to pick a date and time for your visit. You can choose either a counselor or therapist based on your preference.

Our Team utilized web development tools such as Bootstrap, html, CSS and JavaScript. We also utilized ChatGPT AI to bring our API to life and copilot to facilitate faster productivity. We used an Express server to bring our application to more people and GitHub for team version control of the project.
